      <p className="text-center text-gray-600 mb-8">
        We are Bex and Oli, partners above and below the surface. Our shared passion for the ocean has taken us across the globe, documenting reefs, teaching new divers and supporting marine conservation efforts.

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">About Bex</h3>
        <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          My name is Rebecca Carman, a Marine Biologist with an MSc Distinction in Tropical Marine Biology and PADI Divemaster with over 500 logged dives. Since 2023 I have worked as the Marine Science Officer for the Reef Cooperative on the Great Barrier Reef, managing, implementing and monitoring reef recovery projects including MARRS ‘Reef Stars’ and Coral Larvae Reseeding.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          I lead scientific monitoring surveys on SCUBA covering fish, coral and invertebrate assemblages and coral predator control. I manage data recording, analysis and reporting using tools like Excel, ReefCloud and Coralnet, preparing updates for marine park authorities and project funders.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Another part of my role is delivering practical training programs to Traditional Owner groups, building community capacity in scientific survey skills on snorkel and SCUBA. These include Eye on the Reef, Great Reef Census, CoTS monitoring and benthic photo quadrats.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Before this position I worked for GBR Biology across multiple tourism vessels, providing marine interpretation, presentations and snorkel tours for visitors and school groups. My background in retail and hospitality helps me adapt communication styles and mentor students of all experience levels.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          My partner, Oliver Doherty, is applying for the Dive Program Coordinator role. Having worked together on the Great Barrier Reef organising SCUBA logistics, I’m confident we would be valuable and entertaining additions to the team.

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">About Oli</h3>
        <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          As a PADI Master Scuba Diver Trainer and former dive supervisor and general manager, I have led operations at centres such as Pro Dive Cairns, Reef Magic and DreamTime Dive & Snorkel. I teach courses from Open Water to Divemaster, manage schedules and mentor staff in fast-paced and remote environments.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Working on the Great Barrier Reef I regularly participated in Eye on the Reef monitoring and supported marine biologists with in-field data collection, weaving reef ecology and conservation into my briefings and courses.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          I’m well versed in compressor operation, gear servicing, inventory systems and logistics. I hold a manual driver’s licence and have extensive boat and tender experience, including rescue training and knot tying which I teach to colleagues.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Beyond diving, I previously worked as a self-employed business English teacher for French companies and have a professional golf background. These roles strengthened my communication skills and ability to teach under pressure. I also handle digital marketing tasks like SEO and managing dive centre Google profiles.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Ultimately I want to launch a hybrid dive and conservation centre with Bex. We’re committed to spending at least a year with GVI to build the foundation for this shared mission.
